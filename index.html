    <h3>Some skills I inhibit:</h3>
    <em> 1. CREATIVITY - I believe I have a creative mind. I have had some of my art pieces in art shows and even have an award in creativity. Creativity is an asset not just in the art field, but in the STEM field. Creativity allows people to develop good problem solving skills by fostering different ideas and viewpoints to a problem.</em>
